# Advent Of Code 2020

### Frustrations so far:
- Day one, part two was an easier version of the ThreeSum problem; woo-hoo! Can't wait for tomorrow. ðŸ˜¡
- I should probably add a helper function for my find() so I don't have those awkward (string | undefined) types.
- I don't think I should focus on performance optimization unless I have to, I didn't worry about that
  for day two and I had a much less stressful time completing the challenges. I feel like Typescript encourages you
  to write pure functions.
