# Advent Of Code 2020

### Week One:
- I'm refining the workflow, I think I'm going to start naming the days and parts by numbers but name the function the actual title of the challenge
- If I get stuck I try to reduce my input down to a few test cases, so I can break the problem into smaller parts
- You need to cast objects **AS** an interface when working with Array.protoype methods

### TODO's:
- port the project to Deno?
