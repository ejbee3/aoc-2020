# Advent Of Code 2020

### Frustrations so far:
- Day one, part two was an easier version of the ThreeSum problem; woo-hoo! Can't wait for tomorrow. ðŸ˜¡
- I should probably add a helper function for my find() so I don't have those awkward (string | undefined) types.
- I don't think I should focus on performance optimization unless I have to, I didn't worry about that
  for day two and I had a much less stressful time completing the challenges. I feel like Typescript encourages you
  to write pure functions.

### Random comments:
- I'm likely going to install and use Deno so I can get rid of the node modules folder on my computer (Deno imports everything through links, but it also has TypeScript out of the box!)
